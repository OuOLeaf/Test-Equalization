## 📈 2. IRT Model Analyze & Visualize

Upon clicking the execution button, it proceeds with two primary functions:
1. **Training**: The IRT (Item Response Theory) model undergoes training
2. **User Redirection**: Users are automatically redirected to the report page designed for visualization and search table.

</div>

## 📊 3. Interactive Graph

This feature offers an interactive graph that dynamically illustrates the relationship between the number of correctly answered questions and the abilities of respondents.

- **Sliders for Adjustments**: Users can manipulate sliders to observe variations in these metrics across different sessions.
- **Responsive Visualization**: The graph responds instantly to slider adjustments, providing real-time insights into the data.
