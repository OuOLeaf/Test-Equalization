## 2. IRT Model Analyze & Visualize

After execution, the IRT (Item Response Theory) model is trained and the user is redirected to the report page for analysis and visualization.

### What I have achieved

- Design an UI to perform statistical analysis within a short time for everyone 

- Train real-time IRT model using bayesian estimation of parameters



### Python Libraries : 
- Girth (IRT Model Package) https://pypi.org/project/girth/ | PyQt5 (User Interface)
