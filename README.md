## 2. IRT Model Analyze & Visualize

After execution, the IRT (Item Response Theory) model is trained and the user is redirected to the report page for visualization and search table.

## 3. Interactive Graph

This feature enables users to interactively explore the relationship between the count of correctly answered questions and respondent abilities. Users can adjust sliders to see how these metrics vary in different sessions.

### Achievements

- **Efficient UI Design**: Developed a user interface that streamlines statistical analysis, making it accessible and time-efficient for all users.

- **Real-Time IRT Model Training**: Successfully implemented a real-time Item Response Theory (IRT) model using Bayesian estimation techniques for parameter analysis.

### Python Libraries Utilized

- **Girth**: A specialized library for Item Response Theory (IRT) model analysis. [Girth on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/girth/)
- **PyQt5**: Used for creating the user interface, offering a comprehensive set of GUI elements. [PyQt5 Information](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)
